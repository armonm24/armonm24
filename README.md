- Last year I had a great time in Computer Science, so I'm back for year 2. Before Highschool I took tech class in middle school and designed a website. 
- Reasons for taking Computer Science.
   -  Having coding knowledge and uderstanding programming languages is very useful in todays world 
   -  To gain more problem solving skills
   -  To learn more about how technology works and functions 
   -  See how far my interest in Computer Science will take me
- I play tennis and like to hang out with friends and eat.
- I am interested in game design and am learning how to make more and more complex games.
